# FotaHub&reg; Embedded Device SDK for ESP8266&reg;
The FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for ESP8266&reg; enables developers to create firmware for ESP8266&reg;-based IoT devices that can be updated through [FotaHub](http://fotahub.com). It provides an C99-based FotaHub client library along with a set of examples illustrating how the latter can be used and integrated in real applications.

# Installation
To use the FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for ESP8266&reg;, the following tools must be available on your laptop or computer:
* :construction: *under construction*

# Getting started
The best way to get started with the FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for ESP8266&reg; is to try out and study the included examples:
* **Simple** - "Hello World" of firmware over-the-air updating with FotaHub&reg; (:construction: *under construction*)
* **Revertible** - Downloads and launches a new firmware version provided at FotaHub&reg;, reverts to the previous version if something goes wrong (:construction: *under construction*)
